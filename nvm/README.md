This directory is used as a git subtree. The master copy is at

    https://github.com/ARMmbed/nanomesh-nvm

Do not edit files in this directory directly unless you are
working on a clone of that repository. If you are seeing this
as a subdirectory of another repository, it has been pulled
in via git subtree.

To take the latest version of the nanomesh-nvm reference code
into a repository containing it as a subtree, use the command:

    git subtree pull --prefix=your-path/to/nvm-code \
           git@github.com:ARMmbed/nanomesh-nvm.git master

To take this code into use as a subtree for the first time,
use the command:

    git subtree add --prefix=your-path/to/nvm-code \
            git@github.com:ARMmbed/nanomesh-nvm.git master

See 'git help subtree' for more information.
